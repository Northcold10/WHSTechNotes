There are many ways that using a AI tool can cause some promblems like they give you the wrond answer or you type soethin you didnt want and you didnt relized and if you type something to fast or type many words that arent spell right the AI might get confuse and not understand so i feel like we shouldnt use AI assitance only if were carful or we might now know the ai was right but its not always a bad thing it can help you with learning or just asking a question that you cant find online so AI tools do have some risk to it but they can be easily avoided if you are carful witth typing what you need and double checking what you ask the AI but I belieave we shouldnt relie on AI tools cause they can be wrong sometimes they can be useful sometimes but sometimes they might give you the wrond thing so its betetr to do things yourself instead of relying on a AI tool and sometimes the AI tools might not know what your saying and it will get confuse but AI cann be useful sometimes but not all the time.

A carrer that i want to do in teh future that requries coding is being a software engineer. a software engineer is always gonna deal with coding because a example of being a software engineer is making video games and we have to code to make the characters on screen to walk,talk,and picking or dropping items. and there might be in error in the coding so we also have to fix that and if were working like in non gaming like google where we have to code there aswell and thats what being a software enginner have to do with coding.
