There are many ways that using a AI tool can cause some promblems like they give you the wrond answer or you type soethin you didnt want and you didnt relized and if you type something to fast or type many words that arent spell right the AI might get confuse and not understand so i feel like we shouldnt use AI assitance only if were carful or we might now know the ai was right but its not always a bad thing it can help you with learning or just asking a question that you cant find online so AI tools do have some risk to it but they can be easily avoided if you are carful witth typing what you need and double checking what you ask the AI but I belieave we shouldnt relie on AI tools cause they can be wrong sometimes they can be useful sometimes but sometimes they might give you the wrond thing so its betetr to do things yourself instead of relying on a AI tool and sometimes the AI tools might not know what your saying and it will get confuse but AI cann be useful sometimes but not all the time.

A carrer that i want to do in teh future that requries coding is being a software engineer. a software engineer is always gonna deal with coding because a example of being a software engineer is making video games and we have to code to make the characters on screen to walk,talk,and picking or dropping items. and there might be in error in the coding so we also have to fix that and if were working like in non gaming like google where we have to code there aswell and thats what being a software enginner have to do with coding.

So a creative way to use AI that will help the world is a AI docter. a AI doctor is a AI that can accurtly know your dignoises accuratly and give you the medicine you will need to cure whatever you have. it can also assist the people who need care can check tempeture and can also heal damages in the body it will be active 24/7 and have a battery that will make it last for a long time then if we need to cahrge it we can switch out the robots this will change the community becuase we will have better and faster healthcare and can possibly save lifes. and thats my idea for the presintial AI challenge.

What i think about working online with a jon as ikea would be bad because i dont know how it will help people because your restocking online there probably thinking of connecting the game to a robot and is able to control it but the robots might malfunction or something but would happen and i dont think is a safe for the customers either and i dont know how companyies would benefit from paying someone for playing a game the only way they can benefit if they actually sell furniture in the game but that highly likly what would happen if they make it to where is helps customers and comapany then i would agree with the statement but there isnt alot of information to go off on at the moment.
