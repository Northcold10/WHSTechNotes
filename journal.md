There are many ways that using a AI tool can cause some promblems like they give you the wrond answer or you type soethin you didnt want and you didnt relized and if you type something to fast or type many words that arent spell right the AI might get confuse and not understand so i feel like we shouldnt use AI assitance only if were carful or we might now know the ai was right but its not always a bad thing it can help you with learning or just asking a question that you cant find online so AI tools do have some risk to it but they can be easily avoided if you are carful witth typing what you need and double checking what you ask the AI but I belieave we shouldnt relie on AI tools cause they can be wrong sometimes they can be useful sometimes but sometimes they might give you the wrond thing so its betetr to do things yourself instead of relying on a AI tool and sometimes the AI tools might not know what your saying and it will get confuse but AI cann be useful sometimes but not all the time.

A carrer that i want to do in teh future that requries coding is being a software engineer. a software engineer is always gonna deal with coding because a example of being a software engineer is making video games and we have to code to make the characters on screen to walk,talk,and picking or dropping items. and there might be in error in the coding so we also have to fix that and if were working like in non gaming like google where we have to code there aswell and thats what being a software enginner have to do with coding.

So a creative way to use AI that will help the world is a AI docter. a AI doctor is a AI that can accurtly know your dignoises accuratly and give you the medicine you will need to cure whatever you have. it can also assist the people who need care can check tempeture and can also heal damages in the body it will be active 24/7 and have a battery that will make it last for a long time then if we need to cahrge it we can switch out the robots this will change the community becuase we will have better and faster healthcare and can possibly save lifes. and thats my idea for the presintial AI challenge.

What i think about working online with a jon as ikea would be bad because i dont know how it will help people because your restocking online there probably thinking of connecting the game to a robot and is able to control it but the robots might malfunction or something but would happen and i dont think is a safe for the customers either and i dont know how companyies would benefit from paying someone for playing a game the only way they can benefit if they actually sell furniture in the game but that highly likly what would happen if they make it to where is helps customers and comapany then i would agree with the statement but there isnt alot of information to go off on at the moment.

If i was in charge of the school whta i would do for AI and tehcnology is that I would want too unbann phones but due to the texas satate law i wont be abe to unbanned the phone and i would want a way to see if a student is using AI becuase i dont belieave AI would help with students learning and for the online game i would want to put a system that will tell me if there still learning if not then the students would be allow to play on the computer but i do think some whould be blocked and offer some learning games for if they need help with certain things they can go play game version of the lessson

https://angelsoler.my.canva.site/ The project that i have created with the canva AI is to inspire high schooler to do coding and canva AI did it perfect it had great information for jobs and how much they pay and also interactive elemts like clicking about ot jobs or the quiz that was at the end of the presentation the best part of the interactive aspect was the quiz but all of it was great and the way that i will make my next canva AI project would be by adding more information and more interactive aspects like a minigame or multiple mini quizese but the one canva AI made was great and didnt have any issues tho it did took alot of coding to make.

It is a promblem that snap is losing money because if they dont have money thhey arent able too help families who rely on the prgram for food and the way technology will be able to help are with apps they can make a apps or a video that explaines what they do and where they can find thhe food banks they may be some challenges like no internet or technology but the food bank can always make bill boareds or poster or they can get sponser from grocery store that may help spread the cause and they way i'll solve food insecurity is by making a app that can help locate food banks or hot meals.

The way app can change the way people in the holidays are apps that give you activity and i feel like this makes tthe holidays better because there are many people that dont know what to do in the holiday and developers should make holiday save for families because privacy is important to everybody if we get holiday tech and they put like a camera or a recorder that will be a invasion of our privacy.

the reason i think thats cuasing the waymo cars to have issues is it didnt have enough testing and  what i mean by that is that the team didnt show the AI in the car that can detect things or they forgot to make it detect thats causing the car to zoom pass school buses and a way i would fix this promblem is that i would do moretesting show the AI what a school bus is and how to detect schools near by then go and test it to make sure everything will work better than before and if it needs moretesting i would also try too make the sensor and AI recognition better because that can be a source of one of the promblem with the car,and thats what i will do if i was in the waymo team.
